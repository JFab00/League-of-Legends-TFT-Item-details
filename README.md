# [Quick Projects] League of Legends TFT Item details
  
In my spare item I like to play videogames... Back in the day I used to play a lot of League of Legends (Now I don't play it anymore)...  
When Teamfight Tactics got released I really liked it, but I struggled remembering the details of the certain items it had, so I've decided to make an HTML file, with a bit of CSS, and through JS see the details of the certain items that were in the game.  
It was really helpfull if you had 2 monitors  

## Images
When you hover over an item the details of the item are shown down there

On the right side of the page I had the details of the certain classes that were in the game, and the "minions" that were in the certain class...
If you hover over one of the "minions" (champions) you get the details of that minion.

Now the details are pretty outdated (even the champions images won't update since are not the same enymore...)  

## Footer
If you want to update this project, be my guest ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£, it would be easier making it from beginning.  
It is kinda bad made, since I could've use bootstrap to make the things easier, but I didn't even know what bootstrap was at that time...  
Also, it has 0 responsive, so don't even try opening it if your monitor dimensions are less than 1920x1080...
